        Liebe Ornelli ü´∂üèº,<br>
        du machst mich einfach fertig!!!<br><br>
        But I wouldn't have thought that, when I saw you for the first time with Jule & Bjarne cooking in the ECO HOSTEL!<br>
        Now almost 2 weeks have passed and so many things have happened!<br>
        I have to say I am really greatful for all the things we did together! It TRULY made my spain experience even more unforgettable! üá™üá∏<br>
        üí•Swoosh pew pew Jumping into the FUTURE sheesh!üí•<br>
        A "bit" of time has passed now and I kinda got into my normal life again, which is actually pretty good.<br>
        But still when I feel a bit down, I like to think of this perfect afternoon at the San Miguel Alto, where we had such nice weather, Bjarne is giving massages and I took your hand and we just layed there. For me this was a pretty intense moment, where I still have vivid memories. Some place where I find myself escaping sometimes. üê¢<br>
        I'm really glad that I got to know my funky Italian, and I really appreciate the pure interest and support you gave me in the things I love to do. Idk if you know what I mean, but just know it means a lot to me!<br>
        And I admire the way you approach things without any doubts, you just go for it, which makes you living your life very intensely and creates your unique character! Never let anything change that! ‚≠ê<br><br>
        But yet again we are 2 very different persons with different goals, but I think for being in the moment we are really connected & harmonise very well together.¬†So actually I would love to visit you on your little island this summer, so we can live some new adventures! Let me know what you think! :) <br><br>
        K√ºsschen aufs N√ºsschen!<br>
